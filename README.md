## Building the Kartoza Handbook as a PDF

### Check out the code

You need both the Kartoza Handbook repo and the mkdocs pdf building repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kartoza/TheKartozaHandbook.git
```

### Install Dependencies

You need to install these packages:

```bash
pip install mkdocs-with-pdf
pip install mkdocs-material
pip install mdx_gh_links
pip install mkdocs-pdf-export-plugin
```

Note the following assets are used during the building of the mkdocs project as a pdf:

```bash
docs/img/kartozaBackgroundBorder.png  
docs/img/logo.png
docs/css/extra.css
docs/assets/*.otf
mkdocs-pdf.yml
```


### Build the documentation

> Note that whenever you add new sections to nav in the mkdocs.yml 
> (used for building the web version), you should apply those same 
> edits to mkdocs-pdf.yml if you want those new sections to appear 
> in the pdf too.

```bash
mkdocs build --config-file mkdocs-pdf.yml
mv site/pdf/combined.pdf TheKartozaHandbook.pdf
xdg-open TheKartozaHandbook.pdf
```
